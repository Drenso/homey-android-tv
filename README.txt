With the Android TV App for Homey, you can seamlessly connect and control any streaming box or TV running Android TV or Google TV. Power your device on or off, launch specific installed apps, and adjust the volume â€“ all from Homey.

To use this app, ensure that Android TV Remote Service is installed on your TV or streaming box. If it's not already installed, you can find it on the Google Play Store on your device.

Due to limitations in the Android TV protocol/implementation some functionality might be limited or not work at all.
For example:
Volume controls might not work
Album Art and Album Info is not always updated
The Youtube app will need one or two keypresses to stop a video, depending on whether the interface is shown or hidden
