### Is this an official app?

No, the Android TV app for Homey is not an official app and is in no way affiliated with Android or Google.&#x20;

It has been created through the dedicated efforts of a group of people who reverse engineered the Android Remote API.
While we strive to offer a high-quality and functional app, we want to emphasize that it is not endorsed or supported by
Android or Google.

### Why is my device unavailable

If you're experiencing issues with your Android TV device appearing as unavailable in the Homey app, there are a couple of common reasons for this problem:

1. **Network Settings**: Sometimes, the Homey app may not be able to connect to your TV due to network settings. Ensure that your Android TV and the device running the Homey app are connected to the same Wi-Fi network. Additionally, make sure that your Android TV is properly connected to the internet and there are no network issues affecting its connectivity.

2. **Crashed Remote Service**: In many cases, the unavailability issue can be attributed to a crashed Remote Service on your Android TV, which is the component that the Homey app communicates with. To resolve this, you can try performing a hard reboot of your Android TV. Here's how:

    * **Completely Power Down**: Turn off your Android TV using the remote control or the power button on the TV itself.

    * **Unplug from Power**: Once turned off, unplug your Android TV from the power source. Wait for about 30 seconds to a minute.

    * **Plug Back In**: Reconnect the power cable to your Android TV and power it on.

    * **Check Homey App**: After your Android TV has fully restarted, open the Homey app again and check if the device is now available.

    Performing a hard reboot can often resolve issues related to the Remote Service and restore connectivity to the Homey app.

If you've tried these steps and your Android TV is still unavailable in the Homey app, please ensure that both the Homey app and your Android TV system software are up-to-date. If the problem persists, you may want to reach out and submit a support ticket.

### Why is my Android TV not found

If your Android TV isn't automatically detected by the Homey app, here are some potential reasons and solutions:

1. **Chromecast Support**: Ensure your TV supports Chromecast, as the Homey app uses this service for detection.

2. **Different Subnets**: Make sure both your TV and the device running the Homey app are on the same network subnet.

3. **Manual Addition**: If auto-detection fails, manually add your TV using its IP address. Find your TV's IP address in its network settings, then add it in the Homey app.

If you encounter persistent issues, check for app and TV system updates, or reach out and submit a support ticket.

### How does the app work?

The Homey Android TV app operates through the use of the Android Remote API. The Android Remote API is a set of
programming interfaces that allow developers to communicate with and control certain features of Android Smart
TVs.

The Homey Android TV app takes advantage of this API to provide users with a seamless integration between their Android
TV and the Homey platform. The Android Remote API is essential to the functioning of the Homey Android TV app.
