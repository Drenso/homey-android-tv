### Is this an official app?

No, the Android TV app for Homey is not an official app and is in no way affiliated with Android or TP Vision.&#x20;

It has been created through the dedicated efforts of a group of people who reverse engineered the Android Remote API. While we strive to offer a high-quality and functional app, we want to emphasize that it is not endorsed or supported by Android or TP Vision.



### How does the app work?

The Homey Android TV app operates through the use of the Android Remote API. The Android Remote API is a set of programming interfaces that allow developers to communicate with and control certain features of Android Smart TVs.&#x20;

The Homey Android TV app takes advantage of this API to provide users with a seamless integration between their Android TV and the Homey platform. The Android Remote API is essential to the functioning of the Homey Android TV app.
