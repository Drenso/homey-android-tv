## Disclaimer

Please note that the Android TV app for Homey is not an official app and is in no way affiliated with Android or Google. It has been created through the dedicated efforts of a group of people who reverse engineered the Android Remote API. While we strive to offer a high-quality and functional app, we want to emphasize that it is not endorsed or supported by Android or Google.

We hope that this app provides a valuable addition to your smart home setup, but we recommend that you use it at your own risk and understand that it may not be as reliable as an officially supported app. We appreciate your understanding and support as we continue to develop and improve the app.
